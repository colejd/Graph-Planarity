# Graph Planarity Algorithms
=======================

This is a program that generates graphs and runs various tests for planarity on them. Written with Python 2.7.

Dependencies:

* networkx
* pydot
* graphviz

To install these dependencies, run:

```
pip install --user pydot
pip install --user networkx
pip install --user graphviz
```
Note: You don't need the ```--user``` flag for typical installation, but you'll need it if you're 
running El Capitan because Apple is just full of good ideas lately.

To run this program, execute 
`python Main.py`
in the command line.
